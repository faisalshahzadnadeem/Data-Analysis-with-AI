## Introduction

The goal of this project is to perform EDA on the `patients.csv` dataset. The dataset contains information about patients, including their age, diagnosis, and lab results. The analysis involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and visualizing various aspects of the data to uncover patterns and insights.

## Dataset

The dataset `patients.csv` includes the following columns:

- `PatientID`: Unique identifier for each patient
- `Name`: Name of the patient
- `Age`: Age of the patient
- `Diagnosis`: Diagnosis of the patient
- `LabResult`: Lab result value for the patient

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involves the following steps:

1. **Loading the Data:**
   - The data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Display the first few rows to understand the structure of the data.

2. **Checking for Missing Values:**
   - Identify columns with missing values.
   - Fill missing values in the `Diagnosis` column with 'Unknown'.

3. **Summary Statistics:**
   - Display basic information and summary statistics of the dataset.

## Data Visualization

The data visualization process includes the following steps:

1. **Distribution of Age:**
   - A histogram is plotted to show the distribution of patients' ages.

2. **Count of Diagnoses:**
   - A count plot is created to show the number of patients for each diagnosis category.

3. **Boxplot of Lab Results by Diagnosis:**
   - A boxplot is used to summarize lab results for each diagnosis category.

4. **Scatter Plot of Age vs. Lab Result Colored by Diagnosis:**
   - A scatter plot is created to show the relationship between age and lab results, colored by diagnosis.

## Installation

To run the analysis, you need to have Python installed. You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/patients-data-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd patients-data-analysis
```

3. Run the Python script:
```bash
python eda_patients.py
```
